# CryptoNotes2021

4/3/2021

Hello guys,
This is the GitHub to create complete notes for the theory part of master degree Cryptography course. If you are personally interested in creating also complete notes for the exercises you can do it on your own and share here, if you wish.

Organisational main points:

- How to divide the amount of work? Assigning to each of us a 1.5 hour slot (2 per week). See Scheduling.pdf file for more details.

- Deadline for commitment? 1 week.

- On which platform? Each of us create a single a LaTex file (including also the pdf version) and, in the end we put all together (or periodically). 

- What do we have to write? Writing word by word of the prof. could be useless. So, we should try to make our best in combining our notes, with italian slides or web knowledge. The final result should be a “studyable” book to pass the exam.
- If, reading others' work, you think that something should be changed for some reason (updating/removing/adding parts) use Telegram group to communicate.

You can find some examples by looking at the first two lessons, already present in the repository. I'm very new to these platforms and languages, so there could be errors (and also it could be not enough!).

If you have any other ideas, please share and propose.
