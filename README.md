# CryptoNotes

Hello guys,
This is the GitHub repository (created in March 2021) to create/update complete notes for the theory part of master degree Cryptography course. 
If you are personally interested in creating also complete notes for the exercises you can do it on your own and share here, if you wish.

Each folder corresponds to a lesson. It is possible that, from one year to another, the lessons change, so you can update them in order to add new topics.

We hope this work is useful to all of you and can help you study these topics and pass the exam.
Good luck :)
