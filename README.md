# CryptoNotes2021

4/3/2021

Hello guys,
Discussed organisational topics are, for now:

- How to divide the amount of work. Possible solution: assign to each of us a 1.5 hour slot (3 per week)

- Deadline for commitment. Possible solution: 1 week of deadline.

- On which platform? Possible solutions are: 1. Each of us create a single pdf and, in the end we put all together (or periodically). 2. Working on a real-time online word station accessible at the same time by all of us.

- What do we have to write? Writing word by word of the prof. could be useless. So, we should try to make our best in combining our notes, with italian slides or web knowledge. The final result should be a “studyable” book to pass the exam.

If you have any other ideas, please share and propose. 
I think we can find a solution before next week. 
For now, if there aren’t other volunteers, I can try to work on the first 3 lessons (tuesday and today lessons).
